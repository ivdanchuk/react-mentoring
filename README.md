# react-mentoring

Counter.js
A component that renders a numeric value and two buttons: one to decrement the value by 1, another to increment the value by 1.
The component should take an initial value in a property.
The component should be written using EcmaScript classes syntax, the `render` method should use `React.createElement` API (without JSX).
